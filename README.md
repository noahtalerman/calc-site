# operation-calculator
This calculator requires the user to select the operation they would like to use BEFORE selected the numbers they want to operate on. This app performs the best on mobile browsers.
 <br>
This calculator is ideal for calculations that involve a long string of the same operation such as "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +..."
<br>
Instead of continuously having to select the "+" button in between each number, the user selects the operator and can then enter a string of numbers. The user must wait for 1 sec after each number they would like enter.
